# SIH_VRAcademicBuilding

Smart India Hackathon is a nationwide initiative to provide students with a platform to solve some of the pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem-solving

Our team qualified the premilinary rounds of Smart India Hackathon(SIH)2020 held during February 2020.
One of the problem statements we aimed for was promoting tourism for cultural places in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Therefore, we developed a prototype of our University Academic Building in VR. The app involved the following features:

1. Look around at ease
2. Move around by looking down beyond a certain angle
3. Look at objects of interest beyond a certain amount of time to obtain information regarding it. The time counter makes sure if the user is interested in it or not.
4. Move through scenes by walking around.
5. Voice commands guiding user.
6. Pause and unpause the 360 videos the user is in, to get a better look
7. 360 photos created using Google Street View camera
8. All photos and videos streamed from an online database thus reducing the size of the mobile application
